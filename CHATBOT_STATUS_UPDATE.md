# Chatbot Status Update

## Current Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Response Logic Fixed
- **Problem:** Questions like "What are your room types and prices?" were triggering generic booking responses
- **Solution:** Reordered conditions to prioritize specific queries over generic ones
- **Result:** Now properly shows room types and prices

### 2. Family Suite Details Added
- **Family Suite Conditions:**
  - **Price:** LKR 25,000 per night
  - **Capacity:** Up to 4 guests  
  - **Space:** Extra spacious family room
  - **Amenities:** WiFi, AC, TV, Private Bathroom, Mini Fridge, Balcony, Room Service, Family-friendly setup
  - **Perfect for:** Families with children, groups needing extra space, extended stays

## Dataset Training Status ❌

**Current Status:** The chatbot is NOT using the Hugging Face dataset you mentioned.

**What's Currently Running:**
- Hardcoded fallback responses in JavaScript
- Python FastAPI service exists but not integrated with trained model
- No machine learning model is currently active

## To Implement Dataset Training:

### 1. Dataset Integration Required
```python
# Need to add to chatbot_service.py:
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("M-A-E/hotel-booking-assistant-raw-chats")
```

### 2. Model Training Pipeline Needed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training with conversation pairs
- Integration with existing FastAPI service
- Replace hardcoded responses with AI-generated ones

### 3. Current Architecture
```
Frontend (chat-standalone.html) 
    ↓ 
JavaScript Fallback Responses (ACTIVE)
    ↓ 
Python FastAPI Service (EXISTS BUT NOT USED)
    ↓ 
Database Integration (WORKING)
```

**Should Be:**
```
Frontend (chat-standalone.html) 
    ↓ 
Python FastAPI with Trained Model (NEEDED)
    ↓ 
Database Integration (WORKING)
```

## Quick Test Results

**Question:** "What are your room types and prices?"
**Expected Response:** ✅ Room pricing list with Family Suite details

**Question:** "Family Suite conditions"  
**Expected Response:** ✅ Detailed Family Suite information

**Question:** "I need a room from December 25 to 27 for 2 guests"
**Expected Response:** ✅ Database search with real room results

## Next Steps for Full Dataset Integration

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install datasets transformers torch accelerate
   ```

2. **Train the Model:**
   - Process the Hugging Face dataset
   - Fine-tune a conversational model
   - Integrate with existing FastAPI service

3. **Connect Frontend to Python Service:**
   - Modify chat-standalone.html to call Python API instead of fallback responses
   - Start Python service alongside Spring Boot

4. **Current Working Features:**
   - ✅ Pattern matching for complete booking requests
   - ✅ Database integration for room searches  
   - ✅ Specific responses for room pricing and Family Suite questions
   - ✅ CSRF and security configuration

## Immediate Fixes Applied

The chatbot now correctly responds to:
- "What are your room types and prices?" → Shows pricing list
- "Family Suite conditions" → Shows Family Suite details  
- "I need a room from December 25 to 27 for 2 guests" → Searches database

**The pattern matching and database integration are now working correctly.** The only missing piece is connecting the trained AI model from the dataset.
