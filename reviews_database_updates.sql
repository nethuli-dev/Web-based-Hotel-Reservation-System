-- ====================================
-- Notes
-- ====================================
-- 1. The reviews table is linked to rooms, customers, and bookings
-- 2. Rating is constrained between 1-5 stars
-- 3. Reviews are auto-approved by default (is_approved = TRUE)
-- 4. Verified stay badges are shown for reviews linked to bookings
-- 5. Admins can respond to reviews via admin_response field
-- 6. ON DELETE CASCADE ensures reviews are deleted if room or customer is deleted
-- 7. booking_id uses ON DELETE SET NULL to preserve reviews if booking is deleted
-- 8. Indexes are added for performance on common queries
